NEO Tracker is a Neo blockchain explorer and wallet.

## Contributing

Welcome to the NEO Tracker community! We're always looking for more contributors and are happy to have you. Documentation on how to contribute can be found [here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Environment Setup

The following instructions for how to setup your development environment for NEO Tracker are known to work on Mac, but should work on any Unix-like system.

### Requirements

- [Node 10.16.0](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [NEO•ONE](https://neo-one.io/)

### Start a NEO•ONE private network

NEO Tracker is best developed against a private network, which we can setup easily with NEO•ONE.

- `yarn install` (install dependencies, including `@neo-one/cli`)
- `yarn neo-one start network` (starts a private network)

By default, NEO•ONE will create a private network with the RPC url `http://localhost:9040/rpc`, but this can be configured in a [NEO•ONE configuration file](https://neo-one.io/docs/config-options). Note for this purpose, only the `network` option is relevant.

### Start NEO Tracker

- `yarn install` (install dependencies)
- `yarn develop` (starts a watched instance of NEO Tracker for development)

By default, `yarn develop` sets up a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database in the neotracker root directory. If you'd prefer to work with [Postgres 10.3](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), this and other options can be configured in a `.neotrackerrc` file. See below for the full list of configurable options.

### Setup Postgres

If you'd like to use [Postgres 10.3](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), here are some instructions for getting started.

We will use the `$PGDATA` environment variable in the following examples. You may set this variable with `export PGDATA=<directory to store database>` if it's not set. For example, on macOS you can use the default data directory with `export PGDATA=/usr/local/var/postgres`.
To make this a "permanent" environment variable, for use in other sessions, you'll want to add `export PGDATA="/usr/local/var/postgres"` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file(s).

- `initdb $PGDATA` (initialize the data directory)
- `pg_ctl -D $PGDATA start` (start postgres)
- `createdb neotracker_priv` (create the database for NEO Tracker)

To connect this database with neotracker, in the `.neotrackerrc` file, set `dbClient` to `pg` and `dbPort` to the port the postgres server was started on (defaults to 5432).

### General Tips

- To reset the local database, simply run `yarn develop --resetDB`.

### Options

The full list of configurable options in the `.neotrackerrc` file. These can be added to the file or passed in as cli arguments.

```js
{
  "type": "all", // Components to run: "all" | "scrape" | "web"
  "port": 1340, // Port the website will be on
  "network": "priv", // Neo network to run on
  "ci": false, // Running as part of continuous integration
  "prod": false, // Compile for production
  "nodeRpcUrl": "http://localhost:9040/rpc", // NEO•ONE Node RPC URL
  "db": {
    "client": "sqlite3", // Database Client - "sqlite3" or "pg"
    "connection": { // Database Connection Configuration (see below for postgres example)
      "filename": "db.sqlite" // local sqlite database filename
    }
  },
  "resetDB": false, // Resets database
  "logLevel": "info", // Sets pino log level globally: "trace" | "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "fatal" | "silent"
  "apiKeys": {
    "coinMarketCap": "", // API key needed to get current price data from CoinMarketCap. You must supply your own key to make this feature work
    "googleAnalyticsTag": "", // Google Analytics Tag
  }
}
```

With a Postgresql DB we have two connection options, a connection string or connection object.

Connection string configuration:

```js
{
  "db": {
    "client": "pg",
    "connection": "postgresql://localhost:5432/neotracker_priv"
  }
}
```

Connection object configuration:

```js
{
  "db": {
    "client": "pg",
    "connection": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 5432,
      "user": "admin" // optional username
      "password": "password" // optional password
      "database": "neotracker_priv" // optional database name
    }
  }
}
```
